# Reversi Unity/C#

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing a Reversi game implemented in Unity and C#. This game utilizes the minimax algorithm for the AI player.

The game includes a basic user interface for the players to interact with the game and a simple AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm to make its move. The game also includes a basic set of rules for the Reversi game and a simple scoring system.

To play the game, you will need to have Unity installed on your computer and some basic understanding of C#. You can open the project in Unity and run the game from there. Once you open the project you will be able to see the game scene, which includes the game board and the UI elements.

The game uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move for the AI, which makes the AI challenging to play against. The algorithm uses a specific depth of the tree search to decide the best move.

If you find any errors or bugs in the game or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

This repository is intended to be a starting point for those who are new to Unity and game development, and as you become more familiar with the tools and techniques, you may want to explore more advanced topics and features.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and happy gaming
